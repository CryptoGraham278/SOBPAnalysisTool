# SOBPAnalysisTool
Tool to analyze all pertinent information about Spread Out Bragg Peak data from OmniPro Incline (Zebra).

7 August 2017 - Chris Hertlein

Will be a test of my python skills to show that I can convert a Visual Basic / Excel Spreadsheet designed to analyze all relevant aspects of SOBP shots into quick and easily readable data for anyone to understand.

Desired features include:
=========================

-Input of the golden curve for the dataset used.
-Input of the exported CSV files directly from OmniPro Incline.
-Mass batch processing of all files and desired analysis.
-Choice of desired output information including JPG and output CSV files of easily readable information.
-Parsing of clinically accepted definitions: 
  -Range agreement (Distal 90?)
  -Modulation agreement (P90-D90 or P95-D95? Or any possible set of numbers)
-Ability to define noise floor and filter out noisy data from the Bragg peaks via a Peak2Skin rejection method.

Analysis features to include:
==============================

-Calculation of Distal Data:
  -Distal 95
  -Distal 90
  -Distal 80
  -Distal 50
  -Distal 20
  
-Calculation of Proximal Data:
  -Proximal 98
  -Proximal 95
  -Proximal 90
  -Proximal Modulation Dose
  
-Distal Penumbra/Fall-Off (D80-D20)
-Estimated Uniformity Region
-Flatness Calculation
-Tilt Calculation
-Dose at Modulation
-Range (D90)
-Modulation (P95-D95)

-Modulation Analysis:
  -Separation of all Bragg Peaks from SOBPs (layers):
  -Calculation of Proximal 90 of each BP (layer)
  -Calculation of Distal 90 of each BP (layer)
  -Calculation of Modulation Length per each additional BP (layer)
